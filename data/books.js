    "isbn": "0062503952",
    "genre": "Health & Fitness",
    "description": "This fascinating account of a Yale-trained psychiatrist's twenty-year experience with Native American healing interweaves autobiography with stories of the Native Americans who challenged his medical school assumptions about their methods. While working as a family physicans in a Native American hospital in the Southwest, Carl Hammerschlag was introduced to a patient named Santiago, a Pueblo priest and clan chief, who asked him where he had learned how to heal. Hammerschlag responded almost by rote, rattling off his medical education, intership, and certification. The old man replied,\"Do you know how to dance?\" To humor Santiago, Hammerschlag shuffled his feet at the priest's bedside. Despite his condition, Santiago got up and demonstrated the proper steps. \"You must be able to dance if you are to heal people,\"he admonished the young doctor.\"I can teach you my steps, but you will have to hear your own music.\" Hammerschlag synthesizes his Jewish heritage with his experience with Native Americans to produce a practice open to all methods of healing. He discovers the wisdom of the Pueblo priest's question to his Western doctor, \"Do you know how to dance?\"",

As Sydney braces itself for a Japanese invasion, Father Frank Darragh finds his pastoral duties becoming increasingly challenging. How should he counsel an AWOL black American soldier who may face death for his involvement with a white woman? And what should he say to another woman\u2014the distressingly beguiling Kate Heggarty\u2014who impresses him with her virtue even as she edges toward sin? When Kate is found murdered, Darragh falls under suspicion. And even if the police clear him, his superiors\u2014and his own conscience\u2014may not. Office of Innocence is a book that\u2019s impossible to put down, dense with moral complexity and alive with period detail.",

    "description": "\"Including inaccurate information about weapons can kill your story before a potential publisher has even finished reading your manuscript. Today's readers of mysteries, thrillers, action/adventure, westerns, true crime, police procedurals, and romantic suspense are better informed about weapons than ever before. If you think you can slip one past these readers, you're wrong. Dead wrong. You don't have to be a 'gun buff' to need this book. If you care enough about your readers and your craft to strive for accuracy, then this book is your comprehensive source for information on: the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of hundreds of weapons; which weapons were available during each period of history, including wars; weapons favored by various types of criminals and terrorists; weapons used by law enforcement; weapons used for hunting. You'll also find a glossary of weapon-related terms and a series of appendices including: a selective chronology of firearms development; comparative handgun identification information; comparative trajectories of rifle cartridges. In the past, this kind of information was attainable only through hours of digging through a variety of reference books. Now it' s available at your fingertips in one handy guide. Make sure your story is accurate--refer to [this book]!\"--Back cover.",
